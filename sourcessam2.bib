		Hi Samuel,
		The Taxicab business is very complex and I hope that you have read our reform proposal on our 
		website http://itaxiworkers.ca/Reform%20proposal%202012.pdf . Moreover, there are over 10,000
		licensed individuals to drive a taxicab in Toronto but there are only about 4800 Taxicabs that
		are owned by individuals and companies. The breakdown can be obtained from the City of Toronto 
		licensing department. The license to own a Taxicab makes one an owner. This gives them the 
		privilege to hire another driver or lease the Taxicab to a driver, except Ambassador Taxicabs 
		that are single operated. There are agents, owners and brokers that operate the dispatch system. 
		The Taxicab business is governed by City Bylaws that stipulate that Taxicab business can be operated from a Taxicab Stand only but there are only 452 Taxicab Stands. There is only one Vehicle Insurance company (monopoly). 
		I know this is complicated, give yourself time to understand and meet with the different 
		stakeholders. I am prepared to assist you. iTaxiworkers has the most experienced Taxicab operators
		in Toronto."
