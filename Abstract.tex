The purpose of this Request for Proposal is to seek a solution to the
problem of chronic pain among taxi drivers in the City of Toronto in
order to improve their quality of life.

Prolonged operation of a motor vehicle causes chronic pain, and taxi
drivers work shifts of between 8 and 12 hours. This results in a
greater frequency of lumbago, knee pain, and neck pain among urban
taxi drivers as compared to the general population. Operation of a
taxi could be significantly improved by the adaptation of existing
solutions to similar problems among bus and truck drivers.

All designs must succeed in reducing both severity and frequency of
chronic pain among taxi drivers, and achieve this at a minimum cost to
the stakeholders. Further, these designs must comply with current
Canadian Motor Vehicle Regulations, install in existing taxis, and
must not reduce available passenger space or hinder ingress and
egress from the vehicle. Solutions are more specifically targeted
towards low-cost additions to pre-existing car seats to mitigate lower
back pain.
